These shell scripts call some python scripts built for the Pylians libraries.
The shell scripts ending with _path.sh are meant to run on all the snapshots within a given output directory that is specified as BASE, while the other scripts are meant to run on the local directory (i.e. work on the single snapshot from which they are called). -- 30 April 2019
